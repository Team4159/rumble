# ⛰️ rumble

![](./demo/output.gif)

Rumble is a messy event management system for the 2020 IRC competition, Relay Rumble that provides a scorekeeper interface and a stream overlay.

State is synchronized across multiple pages using a Socket.IO server that manages a single Redux state, and the stream overlay is made using Chakra UI and Framer Motion.
